# CotEditor Scripts

## What is this?

CotEditor scripts using Shell and `jq` to prettify or minify JSON.

This is a small collection of scripts I created in order to reproduced what I had with my previous text editor.

## Usage

In the CotEditor menu, select Scripts > Open Scripts Folder.
Put scripts in the folder. See [SampleScripts](https://github.com/coteditor/SampleScripts) for more information
